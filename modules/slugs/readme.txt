The menu widget didn't allow the visitors to change to the default language if qtranslate-x was being used. So, adjusted the Language Menu widget to play nice with qtranslate-x.

== Installation ==
**This plugins requires [Qtranslate](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qtranslate/) or [mqTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mqtranslate/) installed previously, if not, it will not activate.**

1. Upload `qtranslate-slug` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. That's all!

= Changing base permastructs =

1. In admin: navigate to *Settings/Slug options*.
1. Set the base permastructs for **post types** and **taxonomies** (If you setup a base permastruct for *categories* or *tags* in *Settings/Permalinks*, these will be overwritten by the translated ones).
1. Save settings and that's all!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It works with posts and pages, but with other content type? =

This plugin allows to translate slugs of: posts, pages, custom post types, categories, tags and custom taxonomies.

= Do I have to configure anything? =

If you want to translate also the base permastructs (ex. *category*, *tag*, etc). Visit the plugin settings page in the admin *Settings/Slug options*

= How can i insert a language selector in my theme ? =

You can choose to:
* use **Qtranslate Slug Widget** in your sidebar.
* place in your template `<?php if (function_exists('qts_language_menu') ) qts_language_menu('text'); ?>`. Options are: `dropdown`, `text`, `image`, and `both`.

= Appears an error 404, what can i do? =

In the admin go to *Settings/Permalinks* or *Settings/Slug options* and save.

= I can't manage translations in Nav Menus. = 

That's because language selector metabox is hidden, if you are in admin *nav menus* screen, press the button **Screen options** (on top and right) and after, check the option *Languages*. It will appear a **Language** meta box on top of the left sidebar.

= How to get the current url in a specific language? =

You can use `qts_get_url()` or the awkwardly named `qTranslateSlug_getSelfUrl()` which is an alias for the first one.


== Screenshots ==

1. Edit page for: post / page / post_type, you can see the meta box for translated slugs on top and right.
2. Add new taxonomy page
3. Edit taxonomy page
4. Qtranslate Slug options page for translate base permastructs of post_types and taxonomies.

* data system changed, no ID for slug type, then it don't needs install `qtrasnlate_slug` table. That means slugs now are stored on meta tables and installation creates a termmeta table with some new *core functions* to access/save data, based on [simple term meta](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-term-meta/). Upgrade process when the plugin updates from older versions.

filter to process the term slug before is saved on the database.  
`args: $term (object), $slug (string), $lang (string)`

`args: $url (string), $lang (string)`

= Todo =

* detect Slug for each language and redirect accordingly in parse_query.

* translate other slugs like attachments.
* qtranslate integration with other plugins like Jigoshop, e-commerce, etc. Addapt **$wp_rewrite**.
