# Module: Slugs

Adds support for permalink (slug/URL) translations to qTranslate-XT.

This module was created from [qtranslate-slug](https://github.com/not-only-code/qtranslate-slug) plugin v1.1.8, integrated as [a module](https://github.com/qtranslate/qtranslate-xt/pull/1060).
For more details see the discussion [Include qtranslate slug into -XT](https://github.com/qtranslate/qtranslate-xt/issues/671).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### It works with posts and pages, but with other content type?
This plugin allows to translate slugs of: posts, pages, custom post types, categories, tags and custom taxonomies.

### Do I have to configure anything?
If you want to translate also the base permastructs (ex. *category*, *tag*, etc). Visit the settings page in the admin *Settings/Slug options*:
- Set the base permastructs for **post types** and **taxonomies** (If you setup a base permastruct for *categories* or *tags* in *Settings/Permalinks*, these will be overwritten by the translated ones).
- Save settings and that's all!

### Appears an error 404, what can I do?
In the admin go to *Settings/Permalinks* or *Settings/Slug options* and save.

### I can't manage translations in Nav Menus.
That's because language selector metabox is hidden, if you are in admin *nav menus* screen, press the button **Screen options** (on top and right) and after, check the option *Languages*. It will appear a **Language** meta box on top of the left sidebar.

### How to get the current url in a specific language?
You can use `qts_get_url()`.

## TODO

In QTS slug options you can change the bases for taxonomies and custom post types.  
So, for example, you can change /category/ for /category/ for english and /categoria/ for spanish version.
But these won't work:
* slug with UTF8 charactes in taxonomies bases: example:  /類別/.. instead of /category/..
  utf8 in taxonomies works just fine: /category_zh/魚/
* slug with UTF8 charactes in custom post type bases : example:  /圖書/.. instead of /books/..
  utf8 in custom post slugs works just fine: /tushu/彩繪中國經典名著/
* translating custom post types archives with custom base name /tushu/ isnt working. but using utf8 in the the default slug, as expected : /中國/
