= New in 1.1.18 =

Let's start with what has been fixed:


* widget is now compatible with wp 4.3. thanks to @adnanoner ( #111) and @gitmad (#112)
* saving taxonomies wont print warning. thanks to @jmarceli ( #113)
* saving post quick edit wont print warnings. thanks again to jmarceli ( #114 )
* Code from wp.org is now been merged with the github account
* Some notices are fixed. Thanks to @rafa-aguilar ( #89 )
* custom post types are fixed! thanks to @MicheleBertoli ( #102 )
* lots of other stuff has been fixed by me thanks to your awesome bug reports!



and now, what isn't working:
In QTS slug options you can change the bases for taxonomies and custom post types. 

So, for example, you can change /category/ for /category/ for english and /categoria/ for spanish version.
But these won't work:
* slug with UTF8 charactes in taxonomies bases: example:  /類別/.. instead of /category/..
  utf8 in taxonomies works just fine: /category_zh/魚/
* slug with UTF8 charactes in custom post type bases : example:  /圖書/.. instead of /books/..
  utf8 in custom post slugs works just fine: /tushu/彩繪中國經典名著/
* translating custom post types archives with custom base name /tushu/ isnt working. but using utf8 in the the default slug, as expected : /中國/

  
 



Thanks for using, enjoy 1.1.18.

If anything breaks, let me know!

Minor fix for the language menu using qtranslate's function

= New in 1.1.15 =
* Fixes the duplicated hreflang links in <head>

= New in 1.1.14 =

The menu widget didn't allow the visitors to change to the default language if qtranslate-x was being used. So, adjusted the Language Menu widget to play nice with qtranslate-x. 
Hope to bring some nice changes that were made in the github repository in the next version. For now, enjoy.

* More updates to the portuguese translation ( thanks pedro-mendonca, pull #86)
* Corrected the link to language files ( thanks pedro-mendonca )
* Added translation for some hardcoded texts ( thanks pedro-mendonca )
* Corrected a link from 'qtranslate' to 'qts' language files ( thanks pedro-mendonca )
* Fixed taxonomies slugs ( thanks to [eirikv's bug report](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/categories-slug-dont-work) )
* Fixed many warnings ( thanks piffpaffpuff, issue #78 and to [pedrodu1](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/warnings-qtranslate-slugphp) )
* Changed the behaviour of "Quick Edit", from the wp forums [1](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/categories-tags-and-quick-edit-dont-show-in-admin) [2](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/quick-edit-inhibited-by-qtranslate-slug-with-wp-41-mqtranslate) ( thanks everyone!! )
* Fixed the menus! Now you can properly use one menu for every language. Use the dropdown section "Languages", and for each item, change the "Navigation Label" and "Title Attribute". Select "All languages", to make sure everything is awesome! All these features were a consequence of fixing all the warnings based on [Gery's bug report](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/qtranslate-slug-conflicting-with-ubermenu). 
* Minor fixes, etc. 

See you next Version!

* new branch, the plugin has been rewrited: now the code is commented and wrapped inside a class, also all code has change and the performance has been increased.
* structural changes:
	* no ID for slug type, then don't install qtrasnlate_slug table.
	* slugs now are stored on meta tables, installation creates a termmeta table with some new 'core functions' to access/save data, based on [simple term meta](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-term-meta/).
* some automation:
	* the plugin generates translated slug automatically from title in empty cases (like wordpress).
	* the plugin checks if the slug already exists (per each language and type / taxonomy), and adds a progressive number in this case (like wordpress).
	* works on ajax requests like creatig new taxonomies on edit post page.
* possibility to translate the base of permastructs for 'post_types' and 'taxonomies' (uses $wp_rewrite).
* added some filters:
	* 'qts_validate_post_slug' : args( $post (object), $slug (string), $lang (string) ) / filter to process the post slug before is saved on the database.
	* 'qts_validate_term_slug' : args( $term (object), $slug (string), $lang (string) ) / filter to process the term slug before is saved on the database.
	* 'qts_current_url' : args ( $url (string), $lang (string) ) / filter to process the entire url after it has been generated.
	* 'qts_permastruct' : args ( $permastruct (string), $name (string) ) / filter to process the permastruct, used for change the base.
* added plugin language textdomain (.pot file)
* new admin options page for save the base permastructs.
